1. The Vision Statement (Hook)

"I've built a working prototype that demonstrates how we can package and sell MCP servers as integration solutions. We're not just using AI - we're selling the infrastructure that makes enterprise AI actually work. My POC proves we can deploy, monitor, and manage these solutions at scale."
2. The POC Demonstration Flow

"Let me show you what I've built:
1. A production MCP server monitoring critical changes via ChangeDetection.io
2. Fully automated - no UI needed, pure API interaction through LLM
3. AWS-deployed with enterprise-grade email notifications via SES
4. This exact pattern can be templated and sold to enterprises"

Key Demo Points:

    Show the LLM interacting with the MCP server naturally
    Demonstrate adding a new monitoring target through conversation
    Show the automated alert flow
    Emphasize: "This took me X days to build - imagine what we could do with proper resources"

3. The Business Model Innovation

Two-Track Revenue Strategy:

Track 1: Assessment & Consulting

"AI Readiness Assessment" Package (\$10-25k):
- Evaluate customer's current tool ecosystem
- Identify MCP integration opportunities  
- Deliver roadmap for AI-enablement
- Natural upsell to Track 2

Track 2: MCP Implementation

"Enterprise MCP Deployment" ($50-200k + recurring):
- Custom MCP servers for their specific tools
- Managed deployment and monitoring
- Monthly subscription for updates/support
- Expandable to multiple use cases

4. The Sales Framework Request

"I need permission to develop our 'AI Readiness Assessment Framework' - essentially a recipe book for our sales team:"

Customer Discovery Checklist:
- What tools do they use? (CRM, ERP, monitoring, etc.)
- What are their integration pain points?
- What's their current AI maturity?
- Compliance/security requirements?

Opportunity Scoring:
- High: Multiple disconnected systems, manual processes
- Medium: Some automation, looking to enhance
- Low: Already have extensive integrations

Solution Mapping:
- ChangeDetection → MCP Server (like my POC)
- Salesforce → MCP Server
- Custom Database → MCP Server
- Each becomes a sellable module

5. The Strategic Advantage

Why This Matters NOW:

    First-Mover: "MCP is so new (announced Oct 2024) that we can become THE enterprise MCP provider"
    Defensive: "Every consultancy will be pitching AI. We're pitching the plumbing that makes AI work"
    Scalable: "Each MCP server we build becomes a template for similar customers"

6. The Expanded Ask

Phase 1 (Immediate):
- Access to 2-3 friendly customers for discovery interviews
- Budget to expand POC (\$500-1000/month AWS costs)
- Legal review for customer deployment model
- 1 sales team member as dedicated partner

Phase 2 (30 days):
- Develop 3 different MCP server templates
- Create sales enablement materials
- Run pilot with one customer
- Formalize pricing model

Phase 3 (60-90 days):
- Package as official service offering
- Train sales team
- Launch to market

7. Risk Mitigation & Competitive Moat

Address the "Why Us?" Question:

    "I've already built working infrastructure - we're ahead"
    "MCP expertise is rare - LinkedIn shows <100 people globally with this skill"
    "Our POC proves we can deliver, not just theorize"

Address Security Concerns:

    "Each customer gets isolated infrastructure"
    "MCP servers only access what customers explicitly permit"
    "We're selling the integration layer, not storing their data"

8. The Metrics Promise

"Success Metrics I'll Track:"

    Time from discovery to POC: Target <2 weeks
    Customer's time to value: Target <30 days
    Expansion rate: Each customer should need 3-5 MCP servers
    Margin: 70%+ (mostly our expertise, minimal infrastructure cost)

The One-Pager Leave-Behind

Title: MCP-as-a-Service: Turn Enterprise AI from Promise to Production

Problem: Enterprises have AI ambitions but lack integration infrastructure

Solution: Productized MCP servers that connect any system to LLMs

Proof: Working POC deployed on AWS, managing real monitoring tasks

Ask: Permission to develop go-to-market strategy and customer framework

Timeline: 90 days to first customer revenue

Handling Objections:

"Is MCP mature enough?"

    "That's exactly why we need to move now - establish ourselves before it becomes commoditized"

"Can we support this?"

    "The beauty of MCP is it's self-documenting through the LLM interface. Support burden is minimal."

"What if Anthropic changes MCP?"

    "We're building vendor-agnostic patterns. The concepts work regardless of specific implementation."
